# 12. Document process and tooling for backing up collections in DataSpace

Date: 2023-??-??

## Status

Discussion

## Context

We need to back up and preserve all data and files from all items in Research Data collections, as they are migrated from DataSpace to PDC Describe, collection-by-collection.  The backups should be stored securely in the cloud and able to be made available for staff to locate a collection or object's preserved data easily from the ARK that was created in DataSpace.
