# frozen_string_literal: true

# We sometimes have data with filenames that contain characters that AWS S3 cannot handle. In those cases we want to:
# 1.  Rename the files to something that is AWS legal. Replace all illegal characters with a _ (underscore)
# 2.  Ensure there are no duplicate file names after the renaming by appending a (1), (2) at the end of the filename
#     if the file has been renamed
# 3.  Keep a record of all of the file names as they originally existed and what they were renamed to
# 4.  The record goes into a file called files_renamed.txt, which contains a list of all files that have been renamed
#     and what they were renamed to, along with a timestamp
# 5.  This files_renamed.txt file gets added to the dataset as a payload file, akin to a README.txt or license.txt
