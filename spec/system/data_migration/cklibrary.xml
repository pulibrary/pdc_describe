      Protein sequence space is vast; nature uses only an infinitesimal fraction
      of possible sequences to sustain life. Are there solutions to biological
      problems other than those provided by nature? Can we create artificial
      proteins that sustain life? To investigate this question, the Hecht lab
      has created combinatorial collections, or libraries, of novel sequences
      with no homology to those found in living organisms. These libraries were
      subjected to screens and selections, leading to the identification of
      sequences with roles in catalysis, modulating gene regulation, and metal
      homeostasis. However, the resulting functional proteins formed dynamic
      rather than well-ordered structures. This impeded structural
      characterization and made it difficult to ascertain a mechanism of action.
      To address this, Christina Karas&apos;s thesis work focuses on developing
      a new model of libraries based on the de novo protein S-824, a four-helix
      bundle with a very stable three-dimensional structure. The first part of
      this research focused on mutagenesis of S-824 and characterization of the
      resulting proteins, revealing that this scaffold tolerates amino acid
      substitutions, including buried polar residues and the removal of
      hydrophobic side chains to create a putative cavity. Distinct from
      previous libraries, Karas targeted variability to a specific region of the
      protein, seeking to create a cavity and potential active site. The second
      part of this work details the design and creation of a library encoding
      1.7 x 10^6 unique proteins, assembled from degenerate oligonucleotides.
      The third and fourth parts of this work cover the screening effort for a
      range of activities, both in vitro and in vivo. I found that this
      collection binds heme readily, leading to abundant peroxidase activity.
      Hits for lipase and phosphatase activity were also detected. This work
      details the development of a new strategy for creating de novo sequences
      geared toward function rather than structure.
