  let(:abstract) do
    "In 2017, seven members of the Archive-It Mid-Atlantic Users Group (AITMA) conducted a study of 14 subjects representative of their stakeholder
    populations to assess the usability of Archive-It, a web archiving subscription service of the Internet Archive. While Archive-It is the most
    widely-used tool for web archiving, little is known about how users interact with the service. This study intended to teach us what users expect
    from web archives, which exist as another form of archival material. End-user subjects executed four search tasks using the public Archive-It
    interface and the Wayback Machine to access archived information on websites from the facilitators' own harvested collections and provide feedback
    about their experiences. The tasks were designed to have straightforward pass or fail outcomes, and the facilitators took notes on the subjects'
    behavior and commentary during the sessions. Overall, participants reported mildly positive impressions of Archive-It public user interface based
    on their session. The study identified several key areas of improvement for the Archive-It service pertaining to metadata options, terminology display,
    indexing of dates, and the site's search box."
